/**
 * ActionHandler is an abstract base class for handling the case where the user
 * wants to perform an action on one or more apps on their iDevice.  A valid
 * action is one of backup, delete,Â ignore, unignore, and restore.  Subclasses
 * are responsible for determining how many and which apps need to be acted
 * upon, whether the apps can be acted upon, and whether the apps are ignored,
 * and then act accordingly.
 * 
 * All subclasses must override the selectors doAction, _doActionCallback, and
 * start in their implementations.  doAction and start must call super at the
 * end of their implementations.
 * 
 * The properties chooserTitle and chooserPrompt must be defined before
 * -[super start] is sent.  action is set after the user chooses an action.
 * hudDetailsText must be set before -[super doAction] is sent.
 * 
 * validActions is an array of possible actions.  It defaults to containing all
 * possible actions, but you must change it before sending -[super start], as
 * you must determine in your subclass which actions are possible.
