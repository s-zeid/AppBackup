Translations

I use Transifex to manage translations for AppBackup.  If you would like to
translate AppBackup to another language, or update an existing translation:

NOTE:  %@ is a placeholder for various items of text that are included at
       runtime.  You need to have the %@ in the appropriate places in your
       translations for AppBackup to work.

  1.  Go to <https://www.transifex.net/>.
  2.  Sign up for a free account or log in if you already have one.
  3.  Go to <https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/appbackup/resource/localizable-strings/>.
  4.  Click on your language and click Translate Now.  If your language is not
      there, click Add Translation, select your language, and click Translate
      Online.
  5.  Update your translation and click Save All when youâ€™re done.
