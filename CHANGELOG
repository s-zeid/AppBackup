Changes in 3.0 "Maserati" (YYYY-MM-DD):
 • AppBackup now runs faster, (after the splash screen disappears), especially on older devices.
 • Fixed a bug when the device is using a language for which the Yes and OK buttons have the same label:  the ActionHandler would fail to perform the requested action after the user confirmed the action.
 • Use a new URL for the app's page on my site.
 • Use HTTPS for links to the Web site.
 • The about page is now valid HTML 5 and has a somewhat refined appearance.
 • The command line interface uses a new syntax and output format.
 • The CLI now has an interactive shell, which is also used by the GUI and is the reason why the GUI is faster.
 • Of interest to developers (these should not affect users):
    · The app listing code has been moved into a separate Python package called iosapplist (http://code.s.zeid.me/iosapplist).
    · The appbackup Python package is now called iosappbackup.  (The Debian package still uses the name "appbackup" for the launcher script installed in /usr/bin.)
    · Both the iosapplist and iosappbackup packages are available through PyPI.
    · The CLI now has a python command for starting a Python shell with iosappbackup/iosapplist already imported and AppBackup/AppList objects instantiated.
    · Python dependencies are now managed using easy_install from Python's setuptools.
    · Major changes to the build process.
 • Starting with this release, major releases of AppBackup have codenames.  (3.0 is "Maserati".)

Changes in 2.0.2 (2011-05-31):
 • Fixed a bug with translations where if something wasn't translated then nothing would appear in the UI (expected behavior is that the English text would appear instead).
 • AppBackup no longer crashes if backuptimes.plist is corrupted or malformed.
 • Updated the Czech, Japanese, and Korean translations.

Changes in 2.0.1 (2011-05-27):
 • Fixed the problem where AppBackup was hanging on the Please Wait screen for many people.
 • Fixed a cosmetic bug with the Please Wait screen.
 • Updated Spanish translation.
 • ini-to-strings.py now sorts the list of language files before converting them.

Changes in 2.0 (2011-05-26):
 • AppBackup now works on iOS versions 4.3.x and later (and it still works with iOS 3; untested on iOS 2).
 • Added a confirmation screen for all actions.
 • Redesigned About screen.
 • AppBackup has been split into two parts:
    · The GUI, written in Objective-C this time.
    · A command-line interface in the form of a Python package.  (Just type appbackup at the terminal to use it.)
    · As a result, the code has been completely rewritten and is much cleaner and object-oriented.
 • The FixPermissions utility can now be used by typing appbackup-fix-permissions at the terminal.  It is still run automatically in the GUI mode only.
 • Updated translations and added new translations for the following languages:
    · Czech - Jan Kozánek
    · Chinese - goodlook8666
    · Greek - Spiros Chistoforos-Libanis
    · Japanese - Osamu
    · Korean - Joon Ki Hong
    · Norwegian - Jan Gerhard Schøpp
 • Changed translations format in the source tree.
 • Translations are now managed on Transifex (https://www.transifex.net/) and converted to Apple's Localizable.strings format at build time.

Changes in 1.0.14 (2011-05-05):
 • SECURITY UPDATE:  FixPermissions now ensures that no directory other than /var is a link.
 • Added the German ß/Eszett to the diacritical mappings used for sorting.
 • This does NOT fix the incompatibility with iOS 4.3.x.  I am still working on fixing that.

Changes in 1.0.13 (2011-01-13):
 • Added the ability to ignore and un-ignore apps in the backup list and when using the All button.
 • Fixed a crash caused by an error in the Dutch translation.  (Tim van Neerbos was consulted about the problem string.  This bug only affected users who have their language set to Dutch.)
 • The unique bundle ID of each app is now displayed under its name in the backup/restore prompt.

Changes in 1.0.12 (2010-11-27):
 • Fixed a bug where AppBackup would crash if the modification time of a backup file was used instead of a non-existent backuptimes.plist entry.
 • Fixed a couple of bugs in the old method of finding apps.
 • Reverted to the old method of finding apps because it is faster.
 • Fixed some problems with the English strings for deleting backups.
 • Fixed logging when deleting backups.
 • Simplified localization code in BackupAll/BackupOne.
 • The action argument of on(OneApp/AllApps)DoAction_withModalView_ takes an unlocalized string now.

Changes in 1.0.11 (2010-11-25):
 • Added a Dutch translation by Dennis Morren.
 • Added a Russian translation by Nikita "ZAY" Peshkov.
 • Added proper error-checking when backing up or restoring/deleting a backup.
 • Added the ability to delete backups (only translated to English and Russian for now).
 • Permissions on /var/mobile/Library/Preferences/AppBackup are now fixed on startup to reduce crashes
    · This is done with a setuid root binary called FixPermissions and can be disabled by making an empty file at /Applications/AppBackup.app/NoFixPermissions
 • The modification time for the backup file is now used as a fallback if the file exists but the app is not in backuptimes.plist.
 • Added Retina images for the icon and splash screen.
    · The Retina icon is slightly different than the low-resolution icon.
 • Re-designed the splash screen.
 • Now released under the X11 License.
 • The Web site's domain name is now pages.srwz.us.

 • Tweaked the debug.log format a tiny bit.
 • Source changes:
    · Setuid root binary called FixPermissions added to fix permissions on startup.
    · PermissionsFix is now FixPermissions.old and is deprecated.
    · Changes related to Python naming conventions and docstrings in include/globals.py.
    · Source tree reorganized, changes and credits reorganized, and build process changed.
    · README and LICENSE files added.
    · Trivial changes.

Changes in 1.0.10 (2010-08-03):
 • Added an Italian translation by Pietropaolo Mastromarco.
 • Fixed a bug where the restore option didn't appear if we couldn't get a localized date string from the operating system, even though the app was backed up already.
 • (Only of interest to developers) Sorted the functions in include/globals.py alphabetically, except for a couple of long ones which were left at the bottom.

 • Fixed another problem when upgrading to 1.0.7 or later from 1.0.6 or earlier.

Changes in 1.0.9.1 (2010-01-13):

Changes in 1.0.7 (2010-01-10):

Changes in 1.0.6 (2009-09-19?):
 • Added a French translation by Marc Klein and I forgot to mention it.
 • Worked around a problem caused by MobileSubstrate support, which was removed.

Changes in 1.0.5 (2009-08-17):
 • Fixed a problem where apps whose .app folders' names had non-ASCII characters in them (e.g. "é" or "™") would crash AppBackup.
 • Support for sorting app names that have accented letters has been added.  (e.g. "Métro" now comes before "Mint")
 • CPU-intensive functions are now executed in separate threads.  This should result in better performance.  Specifically, finding apps and the actual backup and restore processes are now executed in separate threads.
 • The method used for finding apps has changed except for firmware versions below 2.1.
 • Reorganized the code A LOT.
 • Changed the debug logging process.
 • Made other small changes.

 • Added MobileSubstrate support

Changes in 1.0.3final (2008-09-27):
 • Added German and Swedish translations
 • Uses date format according to user's locale and preferences
 • Source is now compiled into optimized Python bytecode to run a little quicker; this may fix some crashing problems people have been having, especially after updating to 2.1.
 • Changes to UI:  All and About buttons moved to bottom; buttons in dialogs are now on separate rows.  This is to better support translated strings.
 • Sorting of apps in the list is now done case-insensitively.

Changes in 1.0.2 (2008-09-02):
 • Fixed a problem where if an app's Info.plist file didn't exist, AppBackup would crash by checking to see if it exists (thanks Steven B.)
 • Fixed a problem where AppBackup would crash if you have a non-directory file in /var/mobile/Applications (thanks Ryan H.)
 • Changed some strings to stress that this doesn't backup the actual apps, but just their saved data
