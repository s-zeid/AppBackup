Changes in 1.0.12 (2010-11-27):
• Fixed a bug where AppBackup would crash if the modification time of a backup file was used instead of a non-existent backuptimes.plist entry.

Changes in 1.0.11 (2010-11-25):
• Added a Dutch translation by Dennis Morren.

• Added the ability to delete backups (only translated to English and Russian for now).

   · PermissionsFix is now FixPermissions.old and is deprecated.
   · Changes related to Python naming conventions and docstrings in include/globals.py.
   · Source tree reorganized, changes and credits reorganized, and build process changed.
   · README and LICENSE files added.

Changes in 1.0.10 (2010-08-03):
• Added an Italian translation by Pietropaolo Mastromarco.
• Fixed a bug where the restore option didn't appear if we couldn't get a localized date string from the operating system, even though the app was backed up already.
• (Only of interest to developers) Sorted the functions in include/globals.py alphabetically, except for a couple of long ones which were left at the bottom.

Changes in 1.0.9.9 (2010-06-10):
• Added a Spanish translation by Ramón Cutanda.
• Changed the debug logging method again.
• Threads now have autorelease pools.
• This version is mainly intended to help me figure out crashing problems that people are having, although the above change might help some.

Changes in 1.0.9.2 (2010-01-14):
• Fixed another problem when upgrading to 1.0.7 or later from 1.0.6 or earlier.

Changes in 1.0.9.1 (2010-01-13):
• AppBackup no longer crashes on a new install.
• Fixed complications when upgrading to 1.0.7 or later from 1.0.6 or earlier.

Changes in 1.0.9 (2010-01-11):
• Attempted to fix AppBackup crashing on new installs.

Changes in 1.0.8:
• There is NO version 1.0.8!

Changes in 1.0.7 (2010-01-10):
• Moved backup location to /var/mobile/Library/Preferences/AppBackup so that iTunes will back them up.

Changes in 1.0.6 (2009-09-19?):
• Added a French translation by Marc Klein and I forgot to mention it.
• Worked around a problem caused by MobileSubstrate support, which was removed.

Changes in 1.0.5 (2009-08-17):
• Fixed a problem where apps whose .app folders' names had non-ASCII characters in them (e.g. "é" or "™") would crash AppBackup.
• Support for sorting app names that have accented letters has been added.  (e.g. "Métro" now comes before "Mint")
• CPU-intensive functions are now executed in separate threads.  This should result in better performance.  Specifically, finding apps and the actual backup and restore processes are now executed in separate threads.
• The method used for finding apps has changed except for firmware versions below 2.1.
• Reorganized the code A LOT.
• Changed the debug logging process.
• Made other small changes.

Changes in 1.0.4 (2009-07-09):
• Works on iPhoneOS 3.0
• Worked around bug where an app that localized its name on the SpringBoard and didn't have a CFBundleDisplayName key in its Info.plist file would crash AppBackup
• Fixed more crash-on-startup bugs
• Added credits for the translations to the About screen (VERY sorry about not doing this earlier, translators)
• Added MobileSubstrate support

Changes in 1.0.3final (2008-09-27):
• Added German and Swedish translations
• Uses date format according to user's locale and preferences
• Source is now compiled into optimized Python bytecode to run a little quicker; this may fix some crashing problems people have been having, especially after updating to 2.1.
• Changes to UI:  All and About buttons moved to bottom; buttons in dialogs are now on separate rows.  This is to better support translated strings.
• Sorting of apps in the list is now done case-insensitively.

Changes in 1.0.2 (2008-09-02):
• Fixed a problem where if an app's Info.plist file didn't exist, AppBackup would crash by checking to see if it exists (thanks Steven B.)
• Fixed a problem where AppBackup would crash if you have a non-directory file in /var/mobile/Applications (thanks Ryan H.)
• Changed some strings to stress that this doesn't backup the actual apps, but just their saved data
• Added support for localization.  If you want to help translate AppBackup into a different language, please contact me.
• Other small code changes
