I would like to thank the following people who paid me lots of money to see their names in lights:

• saurik, for porting Python and PyObjC to iPhoneOS (this whole thing is written in Python!).
• Dave Arter, for writing the Python sample code used as the basis for this app.
• gojohnnyboi, for posting the (Obj-C) source code of his apps so people like me could learn from it.
• BigBoss, for hosting AppBackup on his repository.
• Marc Klein for the French translation.
• Chris Zander for the German translation.
• Magnus Pålsson for the Swedish translation.
• Everyone who has sent me bug reports!

Changes in 1.0.9:
• AppBackup no longer crashes on a new install.

Changes in version 1.0.7:
• Moved backup location to /var/mobile/Library/Preferences/AppBackup so that iTunes will back them up.
• In 1.0.6, I added a French translation by Marc Klein and I forgot to mention it.
• 1.0.6 worked around a problem caused by MobileSubstrate support, which was removed.
