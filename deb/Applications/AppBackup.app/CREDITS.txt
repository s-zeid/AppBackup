I would like to thank the following people who paid me lots of money to see their names in lights:

• The Python developers.
• saurik, for porting Python and PyObjC to iPhoneOS (this whole thing is written in Python!).
• Dave Arter, for writing the Python sample code used as the basis for this app.
• gojohnnyboi, for posting the (Obj-C) source code of his apps so people like me could learn from it.
• BigBoss, for hosting AppBackup on his repository.
• Marc Klein for the French translation.
• Chris Zander for the German translation.
• Pietropaolo Mastromarco for the Italian translation.
• Ramón Cutanda for the Spanish translation.
• Magnus Pålsson for the Swedish translation.
• Everyone who has sent me bug reports!

Changes in 1.0.10:
• Added an Italian translation by Pietropaolo Mastromarco.
• Fixed a bug where the restore option didn't appear if we couldn't get a localized date string from the operating system, even though the app was backed up already.
• (Only of interest to developers) Sorted the functions in include/globals.py alphabetically, except for a couple of long ones which were left at the bottom.
