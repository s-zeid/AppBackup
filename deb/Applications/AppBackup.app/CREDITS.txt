I would like to thank the following people who paid me lots of money to see their names in lights:

• saurik, for porting Python and PyObjC to iPhoneOS (this whole thing is written in Python!).
• Dave Arter, for writing the Python sample code used as the basis for this app.
• gojohnnyboi, for posting the (Obj-C) source code of his apps so people like me could learn from it.
• BigBoss, for hosting AppBackup on his repository.
• Marc Klein for the French translation.
• Chris Zander for the German translation.
• Ramón Cutanda for the Spanish translation.
• Magnus Pålsson for the Swedish translation.
• Everyone who has sent me bug reports!

Changes in 1.0.9.9:
• Added a Spanish translation by Ramón Cutanda.
• Changed the debug logging method again.
• Threads now have autorelease pools.
• This version is mainly intended to help me figure out crashing problems that people are having, although the above change might help some.
