  DEBIAN/ - Debian package control files
  src/
    about-html/     - Generator for the HTML file used in the About screen
    bundle/         - Files included in .app bundle, excluding subdirectories
    FixPermissions/ - FixPermissions (C; fixes storage directory permissions)*
    gui/            - GUI source code and third-party libraries in Objective-C

    python/         - AppBackup CLI and Python package; other Python modules
    usr/            - /usr/bin/appbackup{,-fix-permissions} launcher scripts
  AppBackup.geany - Geany project file; I don't use this (but I do use Geany)
  build - Build a Debian package (./build [device-hostname] [deb-file-prefix])**
  config.dist - Configuration (path to arm-apple-darwin9-gcc) for build and test
  test - Script to test AppBackup on your own device (./test device-address)
  ...

 * FixPermissions is changed to setuid root after the package is installed.
** See Building AppBackup for details.  FixPermissions is not re-compiled by
   default.

Prerequisites for building
==========================
Computer:
 - Ubuntu Linux (other distros, OS X, Cygwin, etc. may work but I haven't
                 tested them)
 - Working iPhone toolchain that has GCC (tested with a 3.1.2 toolchain)
 - bash; dpkg; GNU make; OpenSSH client; Python 2.5 (OS X only), 2.6, or 2.7
Device:
 - Jailbroken iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad
 - Cydia (with at least the default sources)
 - bash, dpkg, ldid
 - OpenSSH server WITH THE ROOT AND MOBILE PASSWORDS CHANGED!
 - AppBackup package dependencies:
    - bash, coreutils-bin, python (versions >= 2.5 and < 3.0)

Building AppBackup
==================
To build a .deb file, run build.  To build a test package and install it on
iDevice for testing, run test.
 * Add your iDevices's IP address or hostnameat the end if CC is enabled in
   config, or if you are running test.
 * Make sure your device has the following installed if you are compiling or
   testing on it:
     * OpenSSH Server (CHANGE THE ROOT AND MOBILE USERS' PASSWORDS!!!!!)
     * ldid
 * You can add a prefix for the .deb file's name at the end if you are running
   build and NOT test (test always uses the prefix 'test_'.)
 * test will open a shell from your iDevice when installation is finished.
 * Examples:
     $ ./build 192.168.7.16
     $ ./build scottPhone test_
     $ ./test scottPhone

Options for build and test are set in the config file.
 * Copy config.dist to config.
 * See config for available options.
 * Compiling binaries is disabled by default; set CC in config to enable it.
 * Precompiled binaries are included in the git repository.

This process has been tested on Ubuntu 11.04 with an iPhone 3.1.2 toolchain,
and an iPhone 2G running iOS 3.1.2.
