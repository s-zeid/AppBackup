Directory structure with descriptions for some files
====================================================
/
  DEBIAN/ - Debian package control files
  src/
    app/  - Main app source code
      *.lproj/ - Localizations
      include/ - Various Python files included by App.py using execfile
      about.txt - Generated from /CREDITS and /CHANGELOG
      App.py - The app itself (along with include/*)
      AppBackup - Launcher shell script
      FixPermissions - compiled binary to fix user directory permissions*
      ...
    util/ - FixPermissions source code
      FixPermissions.c - source code to fix user directory permissions
      Makefile
  AppBackup.geany - Geany project file; I don't use this (but I do use Geany)
  build - Build a Debian package (./build [device-hostname] [deb-file-prefix])**
  config - Configuration (path to arm-apple-darwin9-gcc) for build and test
  test - Script to test AppBackup on your own device (./test device-address)
  ...

* FixPermissions is not setuid root until after the package is installed.
** See Building AppBackup for details.  FixPermissions is not re-compiled by
   default.

Prerequisites for building
==========================
Computer:
 - Ubuntu Linux (other distros, OS X, Cygwin, etc. may work but I haven't tested
                 them)
 - Working iPhone toolchain that has GCC
 - bash, dpkg, GNU make, OpenSSH client
Device:
 - Jailbroken iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad
 - Cydia (or at least the default sources)
 - bash, dpkg, ldid
 - OpenSSH server WITH THE ROOT AND MOBILE PASSWORDS CHANGED!
 - AppBackup package dependencies:
    - bash, coreutils-bin, python, pyobjc, uicaboodle.py

Building AppBackup
==================
To build a .deb file, run build (a shell script).  You can specify an optional
prefix for your .deb's file name as an argument (e.g.
./build 192.168.7.16 test_).

You can choose whether or not to build the FixPermissions binary; a pre-built
version is in src/app.  If you want to compile it, edit config and change the CC
variable to point to arm-apple-darwin9-gcc in your toolchain.  Then run build
with your device's hostname or IP address as THE FIRST argument.  You will need
SSH to sign FixPermissions using ldid; make sure you have SSH on your device,
YOUR ROOT AND MOBILE PASSWORDS ARE NOT THE DEFAULT ONES, and you have ldid
installed.

To disable compiling FixPermissions, you don't need to do anything unless the
default value exists as an executable file on your system.  You can edit config
so that the CC variable is empty; e.g.:
  CC=
or
  CC= #/home/scottywz/opt/iphone-toolchain/pre/bin/arm-apple-darwin9-gcc
Do not provide a hostname or IP address for your device if you do this.

You can choose what to do with old .deb files by changing OLD_DEBS in config.
An empty value or one that isn't a directory will cause build to leave them
alone.  Setting it to /dev/null will cause build to delete them, and a valid
directory name will cause build to move them to that directory.  The default is
to leave them alone, as the default value probably doesn't exist on your machine.

There is a script called test which will build a package whose filename starts
with test_, install that package onto your device, show the debug log using
tail -fn0, and then give you a shell as mobile when you press ^C while tail is
running.

This process has been tested on Ubuntu 10.10 with an iPhone 3.1.2 toolchain,
and an iPhone 2G running iOS 3.1.2.
