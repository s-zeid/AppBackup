AppBackup Translations

I use Transifex to manage translations for AppBackup.  If you would like to
translate AppBackup to another language, or update an existing translation:

NOTE:  %@ is a placeholder for various items of text that are included at
       runtime.  You need to have the %@ in the appropriate places in your
       translations for AppBackup to work.

  1.  Go to <https://www.transifex.net/>.
  2.  Sign up for a free account or log in if you already have one.
  3.  Go to <https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/appbackup/resource/localizable-strings/>.
  4.  Click on your language and click Translate Now.  If your language is not
      there, click Add Translation, select your language, and click Translate
      Online.
  5.  Update your translation and click Save All when youâ€™re done.

Developer note:  The translations are stored here as INI files (this is one of
the few formats supported by Transifex), and the ini-to-strings.py script is
run by build in order to convert them into Localizable.strings files and place
them into the proper .lproj folders.
